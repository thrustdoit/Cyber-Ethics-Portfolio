My First-Hour Priorities

Capture: suspicious email header — confirms sender spoofing and phishing indicators.

Capture: relevant log excerpt — validates failed login attempts tied to the event.

Avoid: full mailbox export — would overcollect and expose private, unrelated messages.

Avoid: entire system log set — unnecessary for scoping and increases privacy risk.

Incident & Evidence Note (Final)

Timestamp & Context

09/13/2025 14:15 ET – Incident reported by Professor Adams during lab session.

User reported receiving a suspicious email with an embedded link.

Initial notification received in class exercise, verbally confirmed.

Authorization

Approval granted by Professor Adams at 14:20 ET.

Scope limited to reviewing provided log and email excerpt; capture only minimum necessary details.

Actions Taken

Reviewed provided system log excerpt in text editor.

Isolated suspicious entries using keyword “failed login.”

Saved copy of suspicious email header into evidence folder.

No live system changes or containment actions performed in this exercise.

Evidence Captured

auth_log_excerpt.txt (SHA256: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e).

suspicious_email_header.eml (SHA256: 0cc175b9c0f1b6a831c399e269772661).

Only incident-related entries captured; avoided collecting unrelated data.

Chain of Custody

Evidence stored in course lab share: \\cybr2100\\incident_notes\\week4 at 14:35 ET.

Access logged: Mohamed Kaba (student), Professor Adams (verification).

Documented in class exercise tracker.

Redaction

Removed non-incident usernames from log excerpt.

Masked last octet of IP addresses not tied to suspicious activity.

No personal emails or credentials retained.

Next Step Recommendation

Containment: block sender domain on mail filter.

Recovery: advise user to reset password and scan device.

Handoff to IT Security team for continued monitoring and final report.

Integrity & Privacy Controls

All captured evidence was hashed (SHA256) at the time of export to preserve integrity. Files were placed in a controlled share accessible only to authorized personnel, with access logged. Redaction was applied to usernames and non-relevant IP addresses to protect privacy while keeping incident indicators intact. This ensures alignment with NIST lifecycle and NIJ/SWGDE chain-of-custody guidance.

Reflection

Looking back, I might have included a screenshot of the alert interface as supporting evidence, but only if sanitized for privacy. I would also clarify redaction decisions in the note for transparency. Next time, I will document who verified the hashes more explicitly. Overall, the exercise showed me how to balance thoroughness with privacy.

AI Use Note

I used ChatGPT to draft and structure this portfolio page. I reviewed, edited, and finalized the content to ensure it reflects my own understanding and class materials.
