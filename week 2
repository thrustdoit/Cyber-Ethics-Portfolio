Principles Summary

Privacy by design means building protections into systems from the start. Notice and consent ensures people know what is collected and agree to it. Purpose limitation means data is used only for the reason it was gathered. Data minimization keeps collection to the smallest amount needed. Proportionality balances the level of monitoring with the actual risk, avoiding overreach.

My Monitoring & Retention Clause

Monitoring & Notice
Hocking College monitors institutional systems, such as email, learning platforms, and network access, to protect operations, safeguard data, and ensure compliance with policy. Monitoring is limited to official systems and job- or student-related use; personal communications are not reviewed unless required by law, investigation, or security incident response. Users receive notice through login banners and the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). By accessing institutional systems, users provide consent to this limited monitoring. The purpose is proportional—focused on maintaining security, preventing misuse, and ensuring academic and workplace integrity.

Data Handling & Retention
Only the minimum information necessary for security and compliance is collected, such as log-in activity, system errors, and policy violations. Access to monitoring data is restricted to trained staff with a legitimate need, and all actions are logged for accountability. Monitoring records are retained for 90 days, unless required longer due to an active investigation or legal obligation, after which they are securely deleted. Individuals who believe monitoring has been misapplied may raise concerns or appeal through the IT Security Office. This approach follows principles of data minimization and proportionality while respecting user rights.

Justification

This clause uses notice/consent, data minimization, and proportionality to ensure monitoring remains ethical and limited. It also reflects the ACM Code of Ethics principle of “avoiding harm and respecting privacy,” which guides professionals to collect and handle data responsibly.

Reflection

If I were to tighten this clause further, I would shorten the retention period to 60 days and provide a clearer appeal process for students and employees. This would increase user trust and reduce the risk of unnecessary data exposure. The balance between operational needs and user privacy directly affects stakeholders, shaping how secure and respected they feel within the institution.

AI Use Note

I used ChatGPT to help draft my Monitoring & Retention clause and portfolio page. Prompt: “Write a college monitoring & retention clause in two paragraphs and a GitHub Pages portfolio entry with required sections.” I revised the output for my style and added retention and appeal details.
