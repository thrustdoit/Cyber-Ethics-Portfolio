Ethics & Law Orientation (Week 1)
My Ethical Lens

My ethical lens is Deontological Ethics (Ch. 2). This fits me because I believe some rules, like honesty, privacy, and consent, should never be broken, even if it seems easier or faster. It gives me a clear guide for making decisions with technology.

Authorization Principle

Authorization means having clear permission before using a system or data. Example: in the campus lab, I can only use the virtual machine assigned to me. Accessing another student’s files without permission would break this rule.

Policy Snippet

Use of the College Lab computers, network, and software is limited to students, instructors, and approved staff for coursework or research. Only use the systems and files you are given. Do not share logins, hack, or scan outside your assignment. Handle data carefully, collect only what is needed, and do not try to bypass security. Report any problems or misuse to your instructor or the IT Help Desk. Violations can lead to loss of access, academic penalties, or discipline.

Reflection

If I improve this later, I will add more examples that show how authorization works in school and at work. These rules matter for students, teachers, IT staff, and the school’s reputation. One mistake can affect everyone.

AI Use Note

I used ChatGPT to draft and shorten my reflection, policy, and portfolio page. I edited the wording to make it simpler and fit the assignment length.
